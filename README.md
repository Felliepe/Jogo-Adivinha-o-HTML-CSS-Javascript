Guessing Game
Overview
This is a simple guessing game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has ten chances to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game also keeps track of previous guesses.

How to Play

Enter your guess in the input field.
Click the "Enviar palpite" (Submit Guess) button to submit your guess.
Receive feedback on your guess and continue until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it's too high, too low, or correct.
After ten incorrect guesses, the game ends, and a message is displayed.
